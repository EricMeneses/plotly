The purpose of this project was to clearly visually identify the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers belly buttons. The way this was executed was by creating an interactive Horizontal Bar Chart, Bubble Chart and a Gauge Chart. The Bar Chart identified  the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the volunteers belly buttons. The bubble chart displayed the amount of bacterial cultures per sample. Lastly, the Gauge Chart indicated the number of times a volunteer cleaned their belly button.
